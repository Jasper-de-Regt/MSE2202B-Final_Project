Gantt Chart needs 
1. Bars 
2. List of tasks, each with a Start and End date 
3. Graphics 
 
Things to do:  
1. Prepare for design review 
2. Design ideas + concepts - overnight (for tomorrow '92s meeting) 
	-> Make a list of tasks that the robot must be able to do 
3. Specifications (if any) for each concept 
4. After preparing concepts, design a SolidWorks model 
5. Prepare for the second design review 
6. Build and program the robot based on design concepts 
 
Iterate the whole robot instead of subsystems. 
 
Gantt chart due March 3rd. 
 
For the design review 
Need: Design problem, progress made, problems encountered, questions and concerns. 
 
Summary: 
	progress - discuss developments that have advanced the project to a higher stage. 
	prognosis - forecast 
	plan - proposed course of action 
 
 ******************10 mins to brainstorm ideas*******************
 
Things we all agree on: 
- 2 wheels (instead of 4) 
- If using a gripper, not the  '93kit '94 VEX gripper 
	- Navigation method -> encoders vs. ultrasonic sensor => Design matrix 
- Circular drive-base 
- Searching for tessaract -> sweep around 1/2 circle around front edge. 
 
 Preliminary design idea:  
-  Sweep sensor around circular drive-base 
- scissor lift 
- 2 wheels  
- height of 17 cm 
 
- For design and manufacturing, use English units 
 
Tasks: 
Tyler -> Gantt chart 
Jasper -> Sensor + Chasis CAD Models 
Chris -> Scissor lift CAD Model 
Mike -> Gate CAD Model 
 
	End time: 7:15 pm
