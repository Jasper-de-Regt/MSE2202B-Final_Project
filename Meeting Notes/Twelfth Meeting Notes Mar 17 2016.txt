Group Meeting start at 12 pm 
 
Goals for: Thursday/Friday 
 
1. Get base and top planes laser cut (wood). 
2. Rough prototype of the arm 
	 -> Finalize design for the arm 
3. Decide on which IR sensors to purchase 
4. Finalize 3D casing for the IR ( & various ) components  
	 -> Send to Eugen 
5. Decide on whether printing or buying the multiplexing circuitry 
6. Draw block diagram/flow chart for code. 
7. Build rough prototype 
	 -> Use early drive base, ultrasonic, and IR sensors & test 
 
Who will do these: 
1. Jasper 
2. Tyler (CAD), Mike & Chris (model) 
3 - 7 Group (may only need 1-2 people per task). 
 
Tested Jasper's arm prototype (see below) 
	- Arm's clearance while resting on top of the drive base is nearly perfect.  
	- End Effector needs to be properly defined  
	- Jasper 's prototype uses an electromagnet but the final design will use the Neodymium magnet 
 
Jasper is getting the base/planes cut and it would be ~$3 / plane or $6 total. 
 
Mike is now investigating how to fasten the turntable piece to the base. 
 
Chris is working on design for end effector. 
 
Tyler is working on CAD model for the arm. 
 
Meeting End at 4:30 pm
