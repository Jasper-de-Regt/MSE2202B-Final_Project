Group Meeting - start at 4:30 pm 
	 - all attending 
 
To-do list today: 
1. Decide on an IR sensor and order it. 
2. Use dimensions from sensors to make a 3D printed case for the IR sensor array. 
	 -> Also calculate how many sensors are needed 
3. Determine # of multiplexers and order them. 
4. Finish end effector design 
5. Designate coding roles 
 
1. Chosen Model TCRT5000 - will order soon 
2. Sensor is digital  -> no need to multiplex 
3. N/A 
4. Will play with design later 
5. Coding Roles 
	- Jasper  - Encoder-motor  -> servo library 
	- Mike  - Block handling 
	- Chris  - Finding black lines  -> tesseract deposit code 
	- Tyler  - Mode 2 
 
Tyler agreed to research suppliers and order the sensors if not ordering through the electronics shop. 
 
Meeting End 5:50 pm 

Group Meeting online - start at 9:45 pm 
 
We compared different suppliers of the aforementioned TCRT5000.
