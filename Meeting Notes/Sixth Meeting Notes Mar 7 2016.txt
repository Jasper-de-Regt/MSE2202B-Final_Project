Group Meeting Start at 1:00 pm 
		- all attending 
 
- Electromagnet would be worse than neodymium magnets 
- Need to find out exactly what material the tesseracts are made of to determine if the IR light will pass through or reflect back. 
 
 
Stuff to do this week 
- Get Magnets before choosing a servo -> today 
	 - torque is determined by magnet's force 
- Get tesseracts specs from Eugen 
- Test the IR sensor (see if it can work with tesseract) on Thursday 
	  -> use fog to figure out the angle it emits at(?) 
- drive base pre-prototype 
	  -> disk 
	  -> servos -> design for stepper -> justify 
	  -> wheels 
	  -> MSEduino mount 
	  -> battery 
- SolidWorks drive base model 
 
Friday => assemble drive base (between calculus & dynamics - after?) 
 
Meeting end at 1:30 pm
