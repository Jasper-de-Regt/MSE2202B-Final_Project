Meeting  - start at 11:30 am 
	- all attending
 
Ideas to detect tesseracts: 
- Whisker switches all around the device 
- An arm on the device with an IR sensor to detect both good and bad tesseracts. 
- A photo gate on the front of the device 
- One large switch on the front of the device 
 
**Switch-based ideas would need a bumper to sweep bad tesseracts out of the way. 
 
Problem with switch based ideas: potential to bump the cube into a wall. 
 
Possible alternatives:  
- Photogate method 
- Ultrasonic sensor OR whisker switch to detect any tesseracts close to the way that may have been missed by the photo gate. 
 
Plan to return later for another meeting from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. 
 
End 12:22 pm
