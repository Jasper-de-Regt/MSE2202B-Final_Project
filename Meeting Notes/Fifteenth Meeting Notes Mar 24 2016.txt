Worked on the Summary Report II in preparation for the Second Design Review. 
 
Meeting Ended at 1:00 pm

Design Review Notes ******************************************************** 
- Need to get remaining parts on the robot 
- Naish is concerned about the little remaining time -> programming wise 
	 -> How to break down the coding? 
- Address the design in the report 
	  -> touch on the shortcomings of the design vs. prototype 
- Don 't neglect the documentation 
	 -> get someone working on PDF 
- Get code going 
- Skip 3D printing (if possible) to get robot working. 
	 -> 3D printed parts and PCB 's are a time luxury. 
- Substance or style in all areas 
- Can use I2C or SPI to connect for communications. 
- If using encoders, don 't mess with I2C 
	->SPI might be better 
- Simplify 
 
End Design Review *********************************************************** 
 
Group Consensus 
 -> Trip a flag (from the proximity/line tracker sensors) 
	 -> send the change digitally + sweep the arm 
 
Tyler - prototype parts for end effector 
Mike - arm, sensors 
 
Things to do for the rest of the project: 
1. Outline control flow						done 
2. Outline code functions						soon (today) 
3. Delegate functions (code) to be written)			today 
4. Write code								soon  -> this weekend 
5. Build sensor arrays (IR 's and ultrasonics)		this weekend (Jasper) 
6. Build end piece							done by Tuesday  -> weekend (Chris, Tyler) 
7. Choose a multiplex (MUX) chip				all  - this weekend  -> Order on Monday 
8. Testing									Some systems on Monday  - Friday 
9. Start Report								next Thursday (Mar 31st) 
10. Final CAD model							next Thursday (Mar 31st) 
11. Check & Finish PDF						Monday April 4th 
12. Finish the Final Report						Tuesday April 5th 
 
 Roles for the weekend: ulnone  
Jasper 	 - Packaging sensors, blue prints (design drawings for parts) 
Tyler 	 - Working on construction of arm, coding of mode 2 
Mike 	 - Coding (IR, arm, servos) 
Chris 	 - End effector prototype 
 
All		 - research a MUX chip(s) to buy 
 
Meeting End at 3:45 pm
