Nineth Meeting Notes - start at 1:30 pm 
		- all attending

Possible problem with photo gates is the connections used to hold the gates may bump the tesseracts together or into a wall.
 -> If the tesseracts get bumped together that's game over.

Proposed solution:
	Use a cup that can fit only one tesseract when a magnet is being used to pick it up.

Solution to photo gate problem:
	Use a downward facing ultrasonic sensor to detect tesseracts. This would act like a proximity curtain which would be used to send a control signal to stop the motors.

Algorithm for moving through the arena:
	Drive from the origin until detecting a tesseract or detecting a wall.
	->	If a good tesseract, pick it up and go back to the origin.
	->	If a bad tesseract, move it out of the way.
	->	If wall detected, turn 180 degrees around an arc and 
		proceed in a straight line until the next wall.

Decided that instead of ultrasonic sensors, we're going to use light sensors from the 1st bot.
Justification: Their short range makes them more appropriate for that task than using an ultrasonic sensor.

Meeting tomorrow at 9 am outside the lab.

Mike - ultrasonic testing
Tyler - light sensor testing & SolidWorks model of magnet holder
Jasper - may CAD new drive base
Chris - detecting tesseracts in mode 2, mechanical system configuration - (coding?)

Naish said that the robot will be disqualified if it lets two tesseracts touch each other.

Meeting End at 2:30 pm
