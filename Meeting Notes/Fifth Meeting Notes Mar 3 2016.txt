- Different size wheels available \'97> check the glass case\
- More research into navigation\
- Design elements (and materials) should be partially aspirational\
	\'97> design to the final product, not the prototype\
* Test sensors\
	\'97> how close/fast does the device have to be to detect the tesseracts\
		\'97 magnetic insensitivities\
	\'97> how would the IR / ultrasonic sensor respond to the tesseracts?\
- Rip relays apart for the electromagnet\
	\'97> check the recycling bins or buy them\
- for electro-magnet manipulator, sliding will be easier than vertical lifting\
-using encoders is okay if slippage is taken into account\
	\'97> use another subsystem (more is better w.r.t encoders)\
	\'97> figure out how to handle the case of getting turned around\
- hinging at the platforms will improve repair time\
- prototype the base soon\
	\'97> test  sensors\
* Prototype with code should be \ul done\ulnone  by next design review.\
- how to handle collisions?\
	\'97> detection speeds\
- tesseracts may be close to the wall\
	- probably not on, but close enough that it would be possible to knock it into\
	and get stuck on the wall.\
- Once a tesseract is \'93caught\'94, cannot touch another one.\
- could use limit switches & hall-effect sensors to filter them out\
* Try putting two tesseracts closely together\
- It is indeterminate whether black lines on the arena will come down the sides of the arena\'92s outer rails\
- gate will not be fixed to the arena\
- Stepper motors tend to be heavy\
	- may miss steps \'97> tune down acceleration\
	\'97> will we be able to accelerate fast enough to get going but not miss steps?\
- avoid delays in the code (it may get marked)\
- don\'92t need to code for sensors not being used\
	\'97> parts must \'93fit\'94 (voltage, current, size restrictions)\
	\'97> BS will be spotted\
		-> must be justified\
- full CAD drawings for anything we design\
	-> label pre-built parts\
- Suppliers \'97> digikey, robotshop\
- Pre-made parts can be modified then 3D printed\
- Email Naish about QFD status & Gantt chart}
