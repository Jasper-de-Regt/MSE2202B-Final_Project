Group Meeting Start 1:30 pm  
		-everyone attending 
 
A review of functional decomposition 
-Jasper is writing pros and cons. 
 
Brainstorming questions for the design review 
 
 ******************** Design Review  *********************
- Different size wheels available   -> check the glass case 
- More research into navigation 
- Design elements (and materials) should be partially aspirational 
	  -> design to the final product, not the prototype 
* Test sensors 
	  -> how close/fast does the device have to be to detect the tesseracts 
		  - magnetic insensitivities 
	  -> how would the IR / ultrasonic sensor respond to the tesseracts? 
- Rip relays apart for the electromagnet 
	  -> check the recycling bins or buy them 
- for electro-magnet manipulator, sliding will be easier than vertical lifting 
-using encoders is okay if slippage is taken into account 
	  -> use another subsystem (more is better w.r.t encoders) 
	  -> figure out how to handle the case of getting turned around 
- hinging at the platforms will improve repair time 
- prototype the base soon 
	  -> test  sensors 
* Prototype with code should be  ul done ulnone  by next design review. 
- how to handle collisions? 
	  -> detection speeds 
- tesseracts may be close to the wall 
	- probably not on, but close enough that it would be possible to knock it into 
	and get stuck on the wall. 
- Once a tesseract is  '93caught '94, cannot touch another one. 
- could use limit switches & hall-effect sensors to filter them out 
* Try putting two tesseracts closely together 
- It is indeterminate whether black lines on the arena will come down the sides of the arena '92s outer rails 
- gate will not be fixed to the arena 
- Stepper motors tend to be heavy 
	- may miss steps   -> tune down acceleration 
	  -> will we be able to accelerate fast enough to get going but not miss steps? 
- avoid delays in the code (it may get marked) 
- don '92t need to code for sensors not being used 
	  -> parts must  '93fit '94 (voltage, current, size restrictions) 
	  -> BS will be spotted 
		-> must be justified 
- full CAD drawings for anything we design 
	-> label pre-built parts 
- Suppliers   -> digikey, robotshop 
- Pre-made parts can be modified then 3D printed 
- Email Naish about QFD status & Gantt chart

Group Homework
Jasper 	-> CAD
Michael -> Infrared acrylic specs
Chris 	-> tight-beam sonar/ultrasonic sensor
Tyler	-> max magnetic field strength for electromagnet vs. 
			neodymium magnet (0.5 in)^3
