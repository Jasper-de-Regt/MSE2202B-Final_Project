Locomotion Ideas

Flying
Pros - can be accurately maneuvered, fast,
Cons - expensive, complex, dangerous (spinning props)

Walking
Pros - sexy, could maybe eleiminate arm (kneel down to pick things up)
Cons - complicated design (many moving parts), difficult to code, expensive, requires a lot of time to design and build

Tracks
Pros - maneuvarable, able to handle terrain changes, easy to program (skidsteer)
Cons - takes up a large amount of robot space, inneficient (power/motor wise), heavy, tessaracts could become entangled

OmniWheels
Pros - extra manuevarable, efficient, compact
Cons - Cost $$, more complex programming (do we really need to move sideways?), wheels have many moving parts (not good for production models)

Wheels
Pros - cheap, easy to code/build, eficient, compact, standard component, easy to manufacture, easy to maintain (just needs occasional cleaning maybe)
Cons - perhaps too simple?
